I'm a student who lives in France. I love making and designing webpages with React. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating app.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to code, read, and play basketball in my free time.
