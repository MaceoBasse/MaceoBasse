I'm a student who lives in France. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML, CSS and JS (and possible React in the future). It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to progam.
- ðŸ˜€ I like to code, read, and play basketball in my free time.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first line of code was not "Hello World!"
